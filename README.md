 💼 Bank Customers Churn Prediction System: Enhancing Customer Retention with Machine Learning 🏦

🎯 The Bank Customers Churn Prediction System is a machine learning project designed to create a reliable tool for banks to better understand and retain their customers. Predicting which customers are likely to leave the bank can be a costly and complex task, making this system an essential asset to mitigate the financial impact of customer churn.

📊 This project utilizes a dataset of bank customers' features, including credit score, age, balance, and geography, to build and compare six different machine learning models. The models employed include logistic regression, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Machines (SVM), Decision Tree, Random Forest, and XGBoost.

⚙️ Each model is trained, evaluated, and compared using various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and AUC score. Through rigorous evaluation, the best-performing model is identified and integrated into a user interface that takes in customer features and predicts the likelihood of a customer leaving the bank.

🔍 The Bank Customers Churn Prediction System has the potential to significantly impact banks' customer retention strategies. By identifying at-risk customers, proactive steps can be taken to retain them, leading to increased customer satisfaction, loyalty, and ultimately improved profitability for banks.

💡 With the power of machine learning, this system empowers banks to make data-driven decisions and implement effective retention strategies. By accurately predicting customer churn, banks can take proactive measures to retain valuable customers, ensuring long-term success and customer satisfaction.
