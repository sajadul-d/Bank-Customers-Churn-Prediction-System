# Bank-Customers-Churn-Prediction-System


The Bank Customers Churn Prediction System is a machine learning project aimed at predicting whether a bank customer will leave the bank or not based on various customer features. The motivation behind this project is to provide a tool for banks to help them better understand and retain their customers. Losing customers can be costly for banks, and predicting which customers are at risk of leaving can help banks take proactive steps to prevent customer churn.

The project involves building and comparing six different machine learning models using a dataset of bank customers' features such as credit score, age, balance, and geography. The six models include logistic regression, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Machines (SVM), Decision Tree, Random Forest, and XGBoost.

Each model is trained and evaluated using various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and AUC score. The best-performing model is then used to create a user interface that takes in the customer's features and returns a prediction of whether the customer is likely to leave the bank or not.

The Bank Customers Churn Prediction System has the potential to help banks identify at-risk customers and take steps to retain them. This can ultimately lead to increased customer satisfaction, loyalty, and profitability for banks.
